# Ray Tracer
Hi! This is my ray tracer code for my computer graphics course at Columbia University, COMS4160. I am really enjoying this project--the coding as well as the math and physics concepts involved. As I implement more features to the ray tracer, such as reflections, refractions, meshes, etc., I also plan to add more here detailing the pen-on-paper diagrams and computations underpinning what the code is doing. 

# Creative scene
One of the coolest things about this project is that you can actually use it to make your own scenes!! The scene file can be found in [raytra_scene_file_format.pdf](raytra_scene_file_format.pdf), and you can use it to make your own images for the ray tracer to parse. One of the scene files I made, which can be found as `3--illumination-and-shading/olio/data/scenes/pink_totoro_astronaut.scn`, defines the sphere and triangle objects in the scene, along with their materials and lighting, and when parsed creates a pink Totoro astronaut!
